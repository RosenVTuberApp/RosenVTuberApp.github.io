### Self PR:
I have a wide variety of interests such as coding, content creating (video & audio editing), singing, anime, DJing, managing a non-profit organization, and rock climbing, just to name a few. Therefore, sharing my numerous passions would attract a diverse and vast audience. In addition, I am also able to pick up new skills quickly. This, I developed in order to keep up with my curiosity, which always leads me to new ideas and places. For instance, I challenged myself at the beginning of the year to build one robotics simulation each week with different models on my own time. I believe applying the skills developed by my self-guided online learning will be valuable for me as a VTuber to create and present unique content in every stream, and connect with a wide and varied audience. 

In addition, my public speaking and event planning skills will help me succeed. I can speak English eloquently and am comfortable in front of crowds. In the past, I have addressed audiences of over 100 people. As project manager of non-profit helping Taiwanese students apply to college in the US, I am required to lead meetings every single week. These experiences have allowed me to effectively communicate ideas, express my thoughts in an easy-to-understand and organized fashion, and keep listeners engaged. One of the feedback from my co-workers and boss is that I can “read the atmosphere” (空気を読む) and make conversations comfortable for everyone. With my experience with and love for interacting with people, it will be easy for me to create a cozy chat room where audience members feel comfortable. 

Most importantly, through studying engineering in a multi-cultural environment for three years, I have gained insight into, not only how to technically navigate the virtual world, but interact with a wide variety of cultural backgrounds, personality types, and individuals with varying interests. As an engineer, I am deeply familiar with streaming technology and will be useful, not only as a Vtube Personality but as technical support regarding software and firmware. Other than my expertise in tech, I also adapt quickly to new environments. For the first 18 years of my life, I lived in Taiwan before moving to the US to attend Georgia Tech. Though English is not my mother tongue, I am now fluent and able to give lectures as a teaching assistant and design comprehensive assignments understood by native speakers. After three years in the US, I have met individuals from all over the globe. Currently, I room with three American roommates and have friends from Israel, Peru, Australia, and Japan, just to name a few. Not only am I open to learning about new cultures, but I also have a great understanding of American gen-z culture. As a user of Reddit, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitch, Youtube, Discord, Line, and about every form of social media that currently exists, I am an active member of and contributor to internet culture. 

My dedication would also make me successful as a Nijisanji VTuber. In my education and extra-curriculars, I seize all kinds of opportunities that come my way and see each through. For example, I have been running 5km each day to keep myself healthy (also due to the anime 風が強く吹いている) while maintaining a GPA of 4.0/4.0 to date. I came to the US due to my desire to learn. Therefore, my goal to create content that attracts and satisfies a growing audience, I am sure will be realized. As a part of NijisanjiI, I will be one of the most dedicated streamers.

Growing up in Taiwan, I am well-versed in the ongoing geopolitical issues in parts of East Asia. Therefore, I know when and how to avoid topics that could cause controversy and deter certain demographics from joining streams. I am also willing to educate other streamers at the company so that no one will put Nijisanji’s reputation at risk. 
Lastly, this is my personal website: https://fakeaemajorrosen.github.io/ and all my records, interests, projects can be found there. There is also a website https://rosenvtuberapp.github.io/ with all Nijisanji application answers on it for you to read! As I mention, I am willing to support Nijisanji with any technology development as a VTuber. (Especially if you guys need a VTuber who is willing to volunteer to build a Nijisanji application website so that the company will no longer need google forms.)

### Share a fun/happy experience, as well as a tough/sad experience you had as a streamer: 
For me, streaming is always a fun experience as taking on a character allows me to and connect with and entertain my audience while sharing my passions. In real life, it is harder to find communities interested in anime or voice-acting projects such as Hypnosis Mic. As a VTuber, I can discuss and share details of my favorite topics with people for hours. Additionally, I can receive feedback from my audience while I am talking about my favorite characters(oshis). This helps me learn to better entertain and motivates me to be the best that I can be. For example, in discussing Hypmic I was roasted for calling SSR cards in the Hypnosis Mic ARB game “mundane.” Quickly a response was: “Yamada Ichiro is never mundane!.” These magical moments of sharing passions and ideas light up my days and are always on my mind. 

An early challenge I faced while streaming was implementing the ideas and activities I had planned to do while anticipating what the audience wants and adapting to their desires. For example, at times, I wanted to stream gameplay of Mario cart and other Nintendo games as I am better at it; however, my audience appreciated me doing “zatsutan” or “ask me anything” types of streams. As a believer in the phrase “customer first,” I chose to go with the audience’s request, while still accommodating gaming into some of my “zatsutan” streams do that my audience is entertained throughout my videos. The challenge of constantly anticipating what the viewers want and succeeding in providing quality content, keeps me satisfied and excited to continue streaming. As a part of Nijisanji, with a larger audience, I would will first attempt a variety of stream types, covering a number of topics and interests. Using market research via social media, polls, outreach, etc. I would then focus on those that were most successful in attracting viewers or those that make me stand out the most. 


### Any other social media/website links that you would like to add (it will be treated as part of your portfolio):

### What is your desired streaming frequency in a week? Do tell us the reason behind your chosen frequency: 
4 ~ 6 times a week. I will stream six days for normal weeks (need one day to recharge and re-organize all my work and study) while streaming four days if I am in a midterm week. I only have 2 required classes left for my degree and am close to graduation. Upon graduation, I plan on streaming daily. 

### Describe the skills you would be confident in using for your live streams:
Here is a list containing all my skillis: ((1))My various skills, touched upon in the Self PR section, help make me an engaging streamer: I am always checking the chat with two monitors, talking or asking questions that address the interest of the viewers, and shifting topics to avoid awkward or inappropriate moments ((2))Voice acting: I have an androgynous voice and I have showcased some of it in my introduction video. In general, I can do the following voice: ikemen(池面) teenage boy, cute Shota(正太) or girl, and a dead-pan, self-depricating “gen-z” girl voice ((3))Content related skills: I am planning to deliver content related to coding and other fun science experiments (such as “Learning coding language with me”. Will elaborate this in other questions in the application), which relies on my academic background. Furthermore, I can represent my creative ideas well through drawing, computer modeling, and the use of various design software (ex: Adobe Suite Products). I also have a background in music editing, singing, and own all formal DJ equipment, which I plan to utilize during karaoke streams. ((4))OBS skills: Setup media and layers including opening and ending animations, scene changes, Zoom in / Zoom out by stretching the image layer, crop image layer by hitting ATL, and using Discord for collabs (Load multiple avatars & Discord Streamkit widgets (ex: voice)). ((5))Other helpful streaming setups: Streamlab chat integration, mirror phone/gaming device(switch) screen to my laptop, using Youtube and Twitch to stream, and setting up all hardware devices such as music affect controller and microphone. 

### What is your main motivation behind wanting to join NIJISANJI as a VTuber? 
As a lover of and active audience member of Nijisanji Streams, I have wanted to contribute to the community that I have fallen in love with. 
I understand what attracts viewers to Nijisanji streams because I am one of those viewers! My passion for Nijisanji World, paired with my skills, background and various interests make me a valuable asset to the company; I can create content that viewers would appreciate, and desire to not only solidify the current fan base that exists, but expand it using my various interests and talents. As one of the audience watching Nijisnaji VTubers’ stream, I learned that the contents being delivered now tend to attract Japanese 二次元(manga, anime, voice acting, …) culture lovers and/or English speaking gaming lovers. My potential content of streaming(ex: gaming, graphic design, see next section) will also be attractive to these audiences, and therefore appeal to the existing fan base. Other fitting into Nijisanji current culture, I am also planning to utilize my engineering background, to create content such as “Learn coding language with me” or “Eating chip ASMR + calculating porosity of the chip bag (the air portion of chip bag),” to attract people who are interested in the STEM area. My motivation for incorporating engineering into my streams is based off my experience at a STEM-focused college, where my peers and industry-mates have demonstrated a shared interest in virtual entertainment, including gaming, but also content that applies information they are familiar with. Combining traditional streaming with science-based challenges and ideas will diversify the current viewership and extend the Nijisanji audience to include new demographics that maybe look for more than just conventional streaming. 

Over the course of the past few years, during the pandemic, spending time online was a respite from the stress and uncertainty of the day. I want to join NIJISANJI as a VTuber is to help create community and bring positive energy to the virtual world. The pandemic makes me realize that a lot of people feel lonely and depressed due to their extended isolation. Since I started streaming privately, watching my viewers enjoy themselves and share their thoughts gives me a great sense of accomplishment, especially because I know many of my peers do not get the traditional interaction they could before much of the world moved online. Surprisingly, my friends say that seeing me talking in character and streaming makes their day, and takes away a bit of their loneliness, even as we sit on opposite sides of the world. With my ability to cheer people up, I want to spread these magical moments to a larger audience.To build a virtual community that is a cozy escape for my audience means individuals can stop by if they have a bad day and just want to have fun or just use the stream as BGM to help them stay productive while working and give them a sense of community. 

Lastly, as a fan of multiple Nijisanji EN streamers, I respect their talent and would love to learn alongside them as a member of the Nijisanji Team. As a part of Nijisanji I will learn from peers, collaborate, work to maintain Nijisanji’s current success while diversifying and expanding their viewership base. 



### What would you like to do as a VTuber? 
Here are a few categories of content that I will stream : ((1st category)) Gaming: [a] Nintendo games: Mario Karts, Kirby, Pokemon, Game Builder Garage, [b] Laptop games: Minesweeper, Minecraft, Genshin, League of Legends, and I would like to try more games like Apex and Elden rings…… [c] Online/Steam: Simulation games, GeoGuessr, thewikigame, UNO, … [d] Mobile games: A3, Project sekai, idolish7, Hypmic arb.          ((2nd category)) Science and Engineering related: [a] “Learn with me (coding language)”, [b] “Fun Science Experiment”, [c]Keyboard ASMR, [d] Coding advice(save it for membership)          ((3rd category)) Others & Let’s have fun category: [a] Unboxing stream (for celebrating goals), [b] Karaoke, [c]Graphic design or 3D character design(learn with me- live2D), [d] Zatsutan(I want to do it in more of a Podcast style), [f]Music (Live DJing, mixing, …)

### As a VTuber who would your target audience be, and why? *
My target audience will be: 1) people between the age of 15~35, 2) students or working people, 3) people from English speaking countries and Asian, 4) people who watch Youtube, 5) people who like androgynous characters, 6) coding or engineering lovers, 7) people who want to learn new things including coding, graphic design, 3D character development, and all my passions with me. 

This is because my streaming content in gaming and Japanese 2D(二次元) culture overlap with current Nijisanji fan’s interests: primarily gaming. This means that my viewers will likely share the same age, occupancy, countries as the current Nijisanji audience. Moreover, I have a androgynous voice that makes me able to do sounds of shinen 少年, shota 正太, shojo少女, any cute or ikemen sound, which makes me a good it for both gender of characters and even be an androgynous character. I know that there is a big audience attracted to such typecharacter from watching anime and playing otome games. However, if another typecharacter is more likeable than the other, I will adopt the voice that works the best for my streams! In addition, my stream will include coding(“Learn coding with me”, “Study with me + Keyboard ASMR”) , obscure scientific knowledge, and science experiments streams(“how do ants form rafts during flood” + “what bubble wand shape can blow the biggest bubble”). These topics will attract new audience members, like those in an engineering field or a science lover of any age. This will expand and diversify Nijisanji’s target audience. Lastly, anyone who has a desire to learn but needs a partner to support them in the process, will watch my streams to gain knowledge and feel comfortable attempting new things. 


### Describe to us how you would realize your dream of becoming a VTuber, and how you would get your target audience to watch your content: *
Here are some of my plans for streaming content that I have sorted according to my previous categories: (1) Gaming: Other than gaming, maybe I make games with the audience with Unity or Game Builder Garage (Titles: “Data behind the encryption key”).  (2) Science and Engineering: Coding stream (“Learn <coding language> with me!”, “Study with me + ASMR”) , obscure scientific knowledge streams (“Google with me: how can ants survive floods”, “Brain cell challenge: building motors with a coil and a battery”), experiments(“what bubble wand shape can blow the biggest bubble”, “what is the porosity of M&M snack pack”, “what is the string factor of American cheese”) (3) Let’s have fun: Karaoke, DJing (I always want to do a mix of Hypmic/idolish7/A3 songs), language learning(“Google translate roast (Chinese<->English): how off could it be”), Zatsutan(“Podcast: answering fan questions” like Hypmic radio on Spotify), Unboxing things such as Japabese Stationery, snacks, ….

To attract a view base and increase viewership I will: 1) Be active on a number of relevant social medias and collaborate with existing popular accounts to gain followers (Twitter, Instagram, …) Additionally, I will announce projects and launch virtual campaigns to create page traffic and increase online reach. I will also search and promote my character name on forums like Reddit or Discord (ego searching) to increase online exposure and, again, increase online awareness. 2) For video content, I will schedule collabs with other VTubers to co-brand and create secondary association (such as collaboration of SK8 & A3 game). This will introduce me to my target audiences and allow my reach to expand to cover a number of Vtuber’s audiences.  3) Make my content as engaging as possible (Doing AMA streams or podcasting streams that take messages, concerns, ideas from the audience.) As I have mentioned before, I am passionate about creating safe environments online for viewers. I am confident that, as a member of Nijisanji, I will be successful in not only attracting viewers but creating community and a strong bond with each viewer that keeps them returning to the channel.
